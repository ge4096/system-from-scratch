# System from Scratch
System from Scratch is an exercise in system programming from the ground up. It aims to implement a simple computing system based on the uncreatively-named SfS ISA designed for this project. It is total and completely unnecessary reinvention of the wheel, done purely as an overly ambitious exercise in system programming.

The several parts that comprise this project are split up into the following directories, each containing its own readme file for further information:
* [asm](./asm/): a cross assembler targeting the SfS ISA, written in C
* cpu: a hardware implementation of the SfS ISA, written in SystemVerilog (coming soon)
* [doc](./doc/): documentation of the SfS ISA and assembler, written in LaTeX
* os: a basic kernel and operating system for the SfS ISA (coming eventually)
